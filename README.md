## What is GECo?
GECo is a node embedding tool that utilizes multiplex heterogeneous gene phenotype network. GECo allows multi-layer gene and phenotype networks. GECo generates gene embeddings using Gene-Gene, Gene-Phenotype and Phenotype-Gene neibhorhood spaces, using the random walk with restart rankings as node sequences.

## WMFunctions.R
Includes functions to generate the walk matrix (transition matrix) for multiplex heterogeneous network.

## RWFunctions.R
Includes functions for random walk with restart, and generation of neighborhood for each nodes in the multiplex heterogeneous network. 

## GECoFunctions.R
Includes function that generates Top N neighborhoods for Gene-Gene, Gene-Phenotype, Phenotype-Gene and Phenotype-Phenotype.

## main.R
Simple R scritp that provides an example of how to use GECo functions to generate different neigbhorhoods of multiplex heterogeneous network by taking input of individual networks of genes, phenotypes and bipartite network.

## GenerateGECoEmb.py
Generates GECo embeddings of genes by utilizing different neighborhoods generated by GECoFunctions.R script.
